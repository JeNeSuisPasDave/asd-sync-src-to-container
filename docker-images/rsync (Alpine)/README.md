# Docker image - rsync, expect

_(Built for OS X or macOS; tested on OS X 10.11.6)_

This is a light-weight image, based on Alpine, that can execute `rsync` commands directly or via `expect`. It is intended to support using `rsync` to update data volume containers.

Run `build.sh` to create the image.
